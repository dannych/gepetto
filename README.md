# Gepetto

A simpler Slack bot.

---

We are going to use NodeJS and JavaScript as our main programming language to develop this Slack bot.

Check node version

run `node --version` my version `v6.3.1`

Start node project

run `npm init` and enter all the way

We will need some helps from a third party plugin to simplify Slack API - BotKit

run `npm install --save botkit`

Now, we are ready to start creating our Bot
