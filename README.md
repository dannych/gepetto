## Setup Project

I assume that you're already *pretty* familiar with your terminal or console, and installed NodeJS.

----

In this module, you will setup your project and its dependancies.

1. Open your terminal
2. Create the project directory `mkdir test && cd $_`
3. Initiate node package `npm init`
4. Install Botkit library `npm install --save botkit`

Congrats, you project is ready! 

**Next:** [Install Bot](https://github.com/dannych/gepetto/tree/2-node)
